The program works as expected. All of the listed critera are fufilled. I also implemented a dictionary that checks to make sure a word is valid for extra credit. My program is a one line scrabble board with two double letter squares. It features a restart button, and a submit word button. It keeps track of your current score and your best score (since opening the page). It also tells you how many tiles are left.
